## Prerequisites

### MySQL

1. Install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
2. Install [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) 
3. Create an empty schema named `book` in MySQL
4. Import `/source/book.sql` file into `book` schema via
    * Replace `USERNAME` with the your local instance MySQL username, which is usually `root`
    * Replace `PATH` with the actual path of `/source/book.sql` file
    * Input the password for your local instance MySQL afterwards

```commandline
mysql -u USERNAME -p book < PATH
```

5. In `book` schema, the following tables are important:
   * `auth_user` stores all the users including readers, staff and superusers 
   * `books` stores the book info
   * `libraries` stores the library info
   * `loans` stores the loan info
   * `reserves` stores the reservations
   * `comments` stores the comments
   * `storages` stores the storage info

### PyCharm

(Recommended, but not necessary!)

1. Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
2. Add Data Source schema `book` at Database in PyCharm
    * If username and password are required, enter the username and password for your local instance MySQL

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
